Example 1: Meeting Request

Poorly Written Email:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Subject: meeting
Body:
hi
can we meet tomorrow sometime to discuss the report
thanks


<!-- 
Problems:

Subject line is vague and unprofessional (just "meeting").
No proper greeting or proper closing.
Lack of clarity (what time? where? how long? what report?).
Lowercase letters make it seem careless. 
-->

Well-Written Email:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: Request to Schedule a Meeting – Discussion on Quarterly Report

Body:
Dear [Recipient Name],

I hope you are doing well.

I would like to schedule a meeting with you to discuss the quarterly report.
Could you please let me know your availability tomorrow between 2 PM and 4 PM? I can adjust to a time convenient for you.
We can meet in the conference room on the 5th floor, or I can set up a Teams call if you prefer.

Looking forward to your response.

Best regards,
[Your Name]

<!-- 
What’s Better Here:

Clear subject line showing purpose.
Professional greeting ("Dear [Name]") and closing ("Best regards").
Specific details: Topic (quarterly report), preferred time window, location/mode options.
Polite language ("please", "looking forward") increases professionalism. 
-->

Example 2: Sending a Document

Poorly Written Email:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Subject: Document
Body:
Here is the document u asked.
let me know if u need anything else.


<!-- 
Problems:

Vague subject ("Document" — what document?).
Informal language ("u" instead of "you").
No greeting, no signature, no context.
Seems rushed and careless.
 -->


Well-Written Email:

Please find the attached document. Let me know if you require any additional information or further clarification.

<!-- 
What’s Better Here:

Specific subject that identifies exactly what the document is.
Proper greeting ("Hi [Name]") and professional closing.
Polite and helpful tone ("Let me know if you require any additional information").
Complete sentences and no texting language.

Summary Tips


When you write an email, ask yourself:
Would someone understand the purpose immediately?
Is it clear, polite, and professional?
Did I give all necessary details without overloading?
