Scenario:
------------------------------------------
A team member misunderstood a task and worked on the wrong thing.

Team Member’s Email:
------------------------------------------
Subject: Task Update

Hi,

I’ve completed the presentation for the product launch next month.

(Problem: You actually needed a presentation for THIS month’s launch, not next month's.)

How NOT to Respond:
------------------------------------------
Subject: Re: Task Update

You did it wrong. I clearly said this month’s launch! Please read emails properly next time.
