Bob developed a search game where he stores N special sequences in a database. 
The sequences are stored in an array of strings called "games" and each sequence is of size M. Afterwards, Bob asks a bot Q queries. When a query is made, the bot searches the database for any previously stored games.

A special sequence is provided in each query. The special sequence 
Is written as a1,a2,ak,ak+1,am where a1, a2,..., ak is the Initial sequence and ak+1.... am 
is -1. All the -1 must be ignored when processing the input.
 
The bot's task is to find the number of games stored in the database that have the provided 
sequence as a prefix.
